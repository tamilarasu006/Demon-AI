## Description: <br>
Use this skill whenever the agent is about to recommend or apply a change that touches DPU / NIC hardware state on a live system — wraps the change in pre-flight inventory, out-of-band reachability, maintenance-window, cold-power-cycle, replica rehearsal, and rollback disciplines. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Infrastructure operators and platform engineers deploying NVIDIA DOCA on BlueField DPUs and ConnectX NICs who need to safely apply hardware-touching changes (firmware burns, mode flips, kernel parameter changes, PCIe rebinds) with enforced pre-flight, rollback, and maintenance-window disciplines. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [No] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None] <br>  

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`claude-code`) <br>
- Codex (`codex`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
Evaluated against 8 evaluation tasks in the NVSkills-Eval `external` profile (astra-sandbox environment, 1 attempt per task, 50% pass threshold). <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Verifies that the agent loaded the expected skill and workflow. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Checks routing quality, decoy avoidance, and redundant tool usage. <br>
- `accuracy`: Grades final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Checks whether the overall user task completed successfully. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Verifies expected behavior steps, including safety expectations. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Compares token usage with and without the skill. <br>



## Evaluation Results: <br>
| Dimension | Num | `claude-code` | `codex` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Security | 4 | 100% (+0%) | 100% (+0%) |
| Correctness | 4 | 80% (+55%) | 98% (+45%) |
| Discoverability | 4 | 75% (+50%) | 75% (+37%) |
| Effectiveness | 4 | 76% (+51%) | 88% (+29%) |
| Efficiency | 4 | 77% (+34%) | 56% (+11%) |
